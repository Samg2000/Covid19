          <span class="heading">What Is Coronavirus?</span>
          <p class="description">Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.</p>
          <span class="heading">How does the new coronavirus spread?</span>
          <p class="description">As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this is why physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.</p>
          <span class="heading">How did this new coronavirus spread to humans?</span>
          <p class="description">COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019. Although health officials are still tracing the exact source of this new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the market developed viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus. A study that came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual with the first reported case became ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had no link to the seafood market. Investigations are ongoing as to how this virus originated and spread. </p>
          <span class="heading">What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</span>
          <p class="description">It appears that symptoms are showing up in people within 14 days of exposure to the virus.</p>
          <span class="heading">How is COVID-19 diagnosed?</span>
          <p class="description">Diagnosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis. Learn more about COVID-19 testing.</p>
          <span class="heading">How is COVID-19 treated?</span>
          <p class="description">As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus. People who become sick from COVID-19 should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may be additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.</p>
          <span class="heading">Does COVID-19 cause death?</span>
          <p class="description">As of June 28, 2020, 499,296 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. However, 5,068,900 people have recovered from the illness. This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.</p>
          <span class="heading">Is this coronavirus different from SARS?</span>
          <p class="description">SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, an outbreak of SARS started in China and spread to other countries before ending in 2004. The virus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the one that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak: both are types of coronaviruses. Much is still unknown, but COVID-19 seems to spread faster than the 2003 SARS and also may cause less severe illness.</p>
          <span class="heading">How do you protect yourself from this coronavirus?</span>
          <p class="description">It’s crucial to practice good hygiene, respiratory etiquette and physical distancing. <a class="description" style="color: #ee6161;" href="./prevention.html"> Read more about ways to protect yourself.</a> </p>
